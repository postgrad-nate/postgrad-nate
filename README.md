👋 Hi, I’m @postgrad-nate, a microbiologist undertaking a BBSRC funded Chemistry PhD at Imperial College London. 

🧪 🧫 🔬 My work involves:
- Bioinformatics (to discover peptide-forming enzymes of interest)
- Molecular Microbiology (to heterologously express these enzymes) 
- Synthetic Biology (to use these engineered organisms to produce therapeutic peptides)

🎼🕹️🍳 My hobbies include: 
- Arranging sheet music
- Video gaming
- Cooking

😎 Hoping to learn some epic coding skills!
