ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @postgrad-nate, a microbiologist undertaking a BBSRC funded Chemistry PhD. 

ðŸ§ª ðŸ§« ðŸ”¬ My work involves:
- Bioinformatics (to discover peptide-forming enzymes of interest)
- Molecular Microbiology (to heterologously express these enzymes) 
- Synthetic Biology (to use these engineered organisms to produce therapeutic peptides)
